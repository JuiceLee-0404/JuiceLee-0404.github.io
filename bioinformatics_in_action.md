# Getting started

## 4 steps of bioinformatics

### Question

#### Top 5 questions in *Science* 2005

1. what is the universe made of ?
2. what is the biological basis of consciousness?
3. why do humans have so few genes?
4. to what extent are genetic variation and personal health linked?
5. can the laws of physics be unified?

#### Top 3 philosophy questions

- what is life
- what is mind
- how universe works



### Information

#### Images

- Fluorescences
- Locations 
- 3D structures
- docking

#### Sequence

- DNA-seq

- RNA-seq

- Epigenetics

  - DNAase
  - Methylation
  - Histone modifications: ChIP-seq

- Interaction

  - Protein-DNA: ChIP-seq
  - Protein-RNA: CLIP-seq
  - DNA-RNA: Grid-seq

  

### Analysis

two keys: ==Data Clean & Feature Extraction==

### Modeling

#### Types

- Math
  - Eg: $y=w_0+\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_ix_i$
- physics
  - Eg: thermo dynamics
- ...

#### Model VS Algorithm

|           |                   purpose                    |      Method      |
| :-------: | :------------------------------------------: | :--------------: |
|   Model   |       transform real problem into math       | Math and physics |
| Algorithm | translate math into computer logic elegantly |      Logic       |
