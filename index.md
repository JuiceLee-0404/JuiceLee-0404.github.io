## Research Interests

- Metabolic Engineering
- RNA sensor design
- Developing basic part for synthetic biology
- Nano delivery system

My current research focuses on developing RNA SenSor based Analysis system in Yeast(RNAssa), which utilize ADAR as the key enzyme. My team is trying to apply this system into multiple application senarios like in situ multi-gene expression detection; engineering strain security system and dynamic monitoring of splice variant.
